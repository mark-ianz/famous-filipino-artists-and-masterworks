                            A Filipino pioneer of Abstract expressionism, multi-media painter José Joya uses bold and
                            vibrant
                            colours with a variety of painting techniques, layering, loose impasto strokes and
                            controlled drips.
                            His harmonious colours are influenced by Philippine landscapes and tropical wildlife. His
                            mastery
                            lies in gestural paintings, where the paint is applied spontaneously on canvas, sometimes
                            directly
                            out of the tube or through the use of broad strokes with brushes.

                            Joya influenced younger artists to explore other mediums such as pottery and printmaking
                            while he served as the Dean of the College of Fine Arts at the University of the
                            Philippines. In 1964, Joya represented the country in the Venice Biennial, showcasing the
                            advancement of modern art in the Philippines.
