                            The Spoliarium is a painting by Filipino painter Juan Luna. Luna, working on canvas, spent
                            eight
                            months
                            completing the painting which depicts dying gladiators. The painting was submitted by Luna
                            to the
                            Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes in 1884 in Madrid, where it garnered the first gold
                            medal.

                            A Filipino pioneer of Abstract expressionism, multi-media painter José Joya uses bold and
                            vibrant
                            colours with a variety of painting techniques, layering, loose impasto strokes and
                            controlled drips.
                            His harmonious colours are influenced by Philippine landscapes and tropical wildlife. His
                            mastery
                            lies in gestural paintings, where the paint is applied spontaneously on canvas, sometimes
                            directly
                            out of the tube or through the use of broad strokes with brushes.

                            Joya influenced younger artists to explore other mediums such as pottery and printmaking
                            while he served as the Dean of the College of Fine Arts at the University of the
                            Philippines. In 1964, Joya represented the country in the Venice Biennial, showcasing the
                            advancement of modern art in the Philippines.

                            A muse, one that has held Benedicto Cabrera&apos;s imagination captive for years: this is Sabel. Undoubtedly a trademark of BenCab’s work is the scavenger woman he would frequently see along Yakal Street in Tondo, Manila. She usually look for scraps of plastic and then Cabrera started drawing abstract sketches of her from his window. Since then, he has drawn and painted Sabel in various forms and context.

                            Anita Magsaysay-Ho, a first cousin to former president Ramon Magsaysay, is one of the Philippines’ pioneering modernist painters. She was the pupil of Fernando Amorsolo, whose influence can sometimes be seen in her landscape artworks such as Fish Harvest At Dawn and Three Women In A Landscape. However, her personal signature is independent of her famous teacher and lies not just in her style but also in her subjects; which most notably are women at work.
